Blue tooth shield, Arduino and Android

For building a mobile particulate matter pollution monitoring. Fusing a Arduino controlling Shenyi dust sensor and am Android tablet.

Alternatives:
1. Tried with Amarino library and apps, felt complex so left
2. App inventor and Arduino with blue tooth shield
3. Crude code and android app

following links were most useful for error free slave connection between Android and Arduino with seed studio blue tooth shield.

For seeing the blue tooth serial in Android

Alternative 2:
App inventor as given in this link

http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=148853.0

is working based on master blue-tooth communication, but master communication was not yet established. 

But found a app inventor source with able to work with slave communication,

so in this direction.
